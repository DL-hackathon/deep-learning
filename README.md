# Deep learning (DL)

Two basic tasks of DL are considered:
* Computer vision: classify food category of [FOOD-101 dataset](https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/datasets_extra/food-101/) by applying Transfer learning technique to ResNet and ViT.
* Natural Language Processing: work with different versions of BERT model and use it to solve the [RuCoLa](https://rucola-benchmark.com/) task.
